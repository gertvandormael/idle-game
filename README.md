# Idle game

## Notice
This was my first real Vue.js project and while making this I ran into some issues that made it hard to add new features.

A lot of things are connected with each other (skill, upgrades, ...). So for this reason I made everything in 1 component (Game.vue). Ofcourse this resulted in messy code and difficulties to add more features.

So for that reason I completely remade this project and split it up into multiple components. I used Vuex for state management between components and made it easier to quickly add songs. 

I'm still leaving this repo online but please check out my reworked version :)
